# ExceptionBuddy UI

[![WIP](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-WIP-yellow.svg)](#)

> React single-page app for ExceptionBuddy—paste your .NET stack trace and get back AI-driven diagnostic tips and code-fix guidance.  
> _Work in progress—initial prototype._

## 🚧 Under Construction

I’m building the core UI right now. Expect:

- A textarea to input your stack trace  
- “Analyze” button that calls the API and displays the AI response  
- Docker Compose setup for full-stack local testing  
- Automated CI (npm install & npm run build)
